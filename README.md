# ServeSpace  
**ServeSpace** is a volunteer management system built using Django. It enables organizations to efficiently manage their volunteers by providing features like profile management, scheduling, and participation tracking.  


## üßë‚Äçüíª User Roles & Features

ServeSpace has three primary user roles, each with distinct features and capabilities:

### 1. **Admin**
The Admin role has full control over the application and can manage all users and settings. Features for Admin:
- **User Management**: Admin can delete, and view all users, including volunteers and organizations.
- **Dashboard Access**: Access to the overall dashboard, where Admin can view activity reports, registration statistics, and system logs.
- **Data Overview**: Admin has access to all the data in the system, including volunteer hours, organization progress, and completed projects.

### 2. **Organization (Org)**
Organizations can manage volunteers and oversee projects or campaigns. Features for Organizations:
- **Volunteer Management**: Org users can view, accept, or reject volunteers for specific tasks or projects.
- **Project Management**: Create and manage volunteer opportunities or events, track their progress, and assign tasks to volunteers.
- **Communicate with Volunteers**: Send messages or updates to volunteers working on specific projects.

### 3. **Volunteer**
Volunteers can register, view, and participate in projects, but have limited access compared to Admin and Organizations. Features for Volunteers:
- **Profile Management**: Volunteers can update their personal information, contact details, and preferences.
- **Browse Volunteer Opportunities**: Volunteers can view available projects and events in the organization, and register for the ones they are interested in.
- **Notifications**: Receive updates and notifications about project changes, upcoming events, and organizational news.
  
### 4. **Leaderboard**
The **Leaderboard** feature ranks volunteers based on their contribution, allowing a competitive and rewarding environment. Features for Leaderboard:
- **Volunteer Ranking**: Volunteers are ranked based on the total hours worked, number of projects completed, or other criteria defined by the organization.
- **Top Performers**: Display the top volunteers with the most hours or significant contributions, fostering a sense of achievement and encouraging more participation.
- **Leaderboard Display**: The leaderboard is displayed on the volunteer dashboard, showing the rankings for top contributors.

### Additional Features:
